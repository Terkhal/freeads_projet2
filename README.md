# Freeads_project2

Another simple responsive shop interface using Laravel for the firstime. 
a small SQL DB, handling products and users.

## My_work

I focused the DB creation / part of the CRUD / the user profil page and its edition.
The main goal was to retrieve what adds the user created and be able to filter them on his profile.
Otherwise i intervened a bit everywhere HTML / CSS / BUGFIX
